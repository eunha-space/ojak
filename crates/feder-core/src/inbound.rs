//! These functions contain no IO: given the parsed activity plus the small bits
//! of context the host already knows (e.g. whether the target account is
//! locked), they return the [`Action`]s the host should carry out against its
//! own storage and delivery. This keeps the *decision* portable and unit
//! testable, while the host owns persistence and transport.
